# Reviewspot: The Back End

This repository contains the logic for the back end of the web application ReviewSpot written in Node.js. The server is implemented with the Express.js framework and a MongoDB database for data and session
storage.

## **Note for Those Asking to Contribute:**

To whom it may concern,

This project is for a Computer Science course in which myself and my partner Eli are both enrolled in.

**While I would love to accept help from others, we cannot do so until this semester ends on 5/7.**

Furthermore, it is entirely possible we will archive this repository (and subsequent ones) at the end of this semester such that we can allocate our time towards other projects.

We appreciate your enthusiasm, and will update the documentation in this repository if the time comes to open it up to outside contributors.

## Startup

npm install

Start MongoDB server

npm run dev
